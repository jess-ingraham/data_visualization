					<p>This graph shows that since 2002, the amount of live shows 18 to 35 year-olds have been going to, has been decreasing. This may be because the cost of seeing professional performances have gone up while funding for the arts has become more and more scarse. There are probably not as many community or school opportunities to attended live performances. The graph makes sense from this perspective and I'm sure there are many other factors that are a part of whether someone went to a performance or not. I think this data would be interesting to anyone who wanted to make  a push for increased arts education, for funding of community productions, or for decreasing the prices for professional performances. I would be interested to see data from 2016 and see if there is any increase in the based upon "Hamilton" opening and creating more publicity for Broadway. <br /><br /> The breakdown for each year the survey was taken is below.</p>

					<p>These graphs are very interesting to me because while the overall number of shows decreases, the breakdown of what type of show is relatively similar. I also find it fascinating that for each year the number of musicals seen is greater than the number of plays and ballets combined. This makes me think that musicals are more accessible or more popular to the 18 to 35 year-olds going to live performances than those not. I'm not surprised that the percentage of those attending ballets is low but I would have thought plays and musicals may have been more even. These charts would be interesting to someone who, again, wants to push for more arts education. They could see that musicals are more popular to the general public of 18 to 35 year-olds and use musicals as a way of outreach or education.</p>

This is a Breach No One Should Get Away With</a></h1>
					<h2>The New York Times &nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; September 8<sup>th</sup>, 2017 &nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; Farhad Manjoo</h2>
					<p>This past Thursday, Equifax, a major consumer credit reporting company, reported a breach of their system that potentially compromised 143 customers’ data. 
					Equifax’s main job is to store credit information and even when they failed to keep it safe, the repercussions will be close to non-existent. According to the New York Times article by Farhad Manjoo, Equifax is too central to America’s financial system to shut down the company. 
					The article then went on to say that even if this major breach in security made people want to remove their data from (or stop sending their data to) Equifax, there is no way to do that. You can ask your bank not to send the data but it probably wouldn’t do much. 
					This means that even though the American people are the ones affected if a security breach of this kind happens, we have no say as to where our data is stored or what happens to it. This incident brought to light just how unregulated the security for a company such as Equifax is, yet we have no way to say, “No thanks” and remove our data. This is, obviously, one of the downsides of storing large, important pieces of information with one company. Yet, to me at least, there is no glaringly obvious solution. Even if Equifax was shut down, there are still other credit reporting companies that will become targets of cyber-attacks. And there is no way for the information to be split up between companies since there would be no way to create a credit report. The only solution is to make sure Equifax enhances their security so a breach of this magnitude does not happen again.

					<h2>Time Magazine &nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2017 &nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; Mahita Gajanan</h2>
					<p>
						At the end of August, Instagram suffered a security breach that released information on high profile users such as email addresses and phone numbers. While this attack was aimed at high profile users, the same bug can be exploited to get information on everyday users. Unfortunately, this isn’t even a matter of whether Instagram should be storing that data since emails and phone numbers are used as log-in information. While Instagram doesn’t store much personal information, it is owned by Facebook, which stores more information. Instagram can pull data from Facebook and can push data to Facebook. So, Instagram could be used as a backdoor to Facebook profiles which, for a lot of people, can hold information on hometown, job location, family members, etc. Though people do decide what they put on social media, there is a certain level of trust that no one else will have access to the full profile except the profile owner. Hopefully, by now, Facebook/Instagram will have fixed the bug that allowed hackers to gain access to the back end of the site. It is also fortunate that the only information that could be pulled was email and phone number and not something such as physical address, or social security number. But even gaining access to email address and phone number can do a lot of damage if people use them regularly, or use the same email and password for multiple sites. <br/><br/>
						Instagram uses PostgreSQL to store their data.

					<h2>The Atlantic &nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; September 5<sup>th</sup>, 2017 &nbsp;&#9679;&nbsp; Namrata Kolachalam</h2>
					<p>
						This article talks of the company Aadhaar, which is the vying to be the world’s largest biometric database. Currently based in India, Aadhaar is gaining more and more traction and collecting more and more data. The company was founded to aid government services and help save them money. People were taking advantage of the system and introducing fingerprint scanners to receive benefits helped to stop that. There are, of course, downsides to relying solely on fingerprints to distribute benefits such as food rations. Small towns can have trouble connecting to the server to pull the needed information, some people are physically unable to make it to the distribution center to have their fingerprint scanned, and, for some, their fingerprints are unreadable. Since Aadhaar started this database to help government and private sector procedures, it will soon be necessary to enroll to file taxes, receive school lunches or health benefits, opening bank accounts, and more. Obviously, this creates a huge problem if there are people unable to access/enroll in the database. These people would not be able to access different benefits needed to survive; they are already being denied benefits because the database is not completely accurate. Aadhaar also receives data about who, where and for what the database is accessed. Meaning, Aadhaar receives information about who opens a bank account and with what bank. This goes past just holding information necessary for participating in government programs. Aadhaar would have information about a person’s life and make it harder for people to receive benefits or even gain new jobs based on past transactions/benefit enrollment. This database is essentially a credit report but with a lot more detail and there is no way to remove something you would rather keep private.
